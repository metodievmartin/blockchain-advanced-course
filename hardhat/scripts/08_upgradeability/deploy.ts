/**
 * DEPLOY SCRIPT â€” UPGRADEABLE PROXY (TRANSPARENT PATTERN)
 *
 * This script deploys an upgradeable smart contract using OpenZeppelin's `@openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades` plugin.
 * It follows the Transparent Proxy pattern, where logic and storage are separated.
 *
 * `TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol` => https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol
 * `ProxyAdmin.sol` => https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/transparent/ProxyAdmin.sol
 * `Implementation Contract` => `hardhat/contracts/08_upgradeability/Treasury.sol`
 *
 * What happens under the hood:
 *
 * 1. A new `Implementation Contract` is deployed.
 *    - Contains the actual function logic (`Treasury` in this case).
 *    - Does not hold any state directly.
 *
 * 2. A `ProxyAdmin Contract` is deployed (if not already).
 *    - A special contract that manages proxy upgrades.
 *    - Only this admin can change the implementation address of the proxy.
 *
 * 3. A `Transparent Proxy Contract` is deployed.
 *    - This is the contract users interact with.
 *    - It holds all the contract state and forwards function calls to the implementation via `delegatecall`.
 *
 * 4. The proxy runs the `initialize(owner)` function.
 *    - Since constructors are not used in upgradeable contracts, initialization is done through an initializer.
 *    - Ensures the contract is correctly set up with ownership and initial state.
 *
 * Result: A fully functioning upgradeable contract, with logic in the implementation and storage in the proxy.
